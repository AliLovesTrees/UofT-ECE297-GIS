# UofT-ECE297-GIS

Hello! This is a course long project written in C++, it was completed with two other programmers: Carmen Lamprecht and Mohammed Amir. The goal was to create a crude replica of a mapping software such as google maps or maps by apple.


This project can be broken up into 4 main sections:

1. Creating data structures in an effort to reduce API calls to create responsive software. The underlying API providing this data is the OpenStreets API.
2. Using GTK to create the graphics for our project
3. Writing a basic Dijkstra's algorithm to enable pathfinding
4. Enhancing this algorithm to solve an NP problem (A variant of the travelling salesman)

The code is copyrighted by the University of Toronto, so it can't be shared publicly. If you are interested, please let me know and I'd be happy to share it with you.
